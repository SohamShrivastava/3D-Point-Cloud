# Differential Transformer for 3D Point Cloud Upsampling

This project aims to improve 3D point cloud upsampling by integrating the **Differential Transformer** into the **PU-Transformer** architecture (ACCV 2022).

## Objective
To enhance point cloud detail and accuracy by replacing the standard self-attention block in PU-Transformer with a **Differential Attention** mechanism, which focuses on the relative differences between points.

## Planned Tasks
- Study PU-Transformer architecture and dataset setup.
- Understand and adapt Differential Transformer code.
- Replace attention modules and train the modified network.
- Evaluate using Chamfer Distance and visual comparison.
